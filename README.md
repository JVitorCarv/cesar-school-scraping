# How to install the program

Since Chrome is one of the most popular web browsers, this program uses ChromeDriver 103.0.5060.134. Please verify that your Chrome browser runs at the same version as the driver. Newer versions of the chromedriver.exe can be found at https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads.

It also runs on Python 3.10.5, which can be downloaded at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

1. Download an IDE (ex: VSCode, PyCharm, etc.)
   <br>
2. Clone the git repository at https://github.com/JVitorCarv/cesar-qa-challenge.git
   <br>
3. Start a virtual environment at the program's folder<br>
   `py -m venv venv`

4. Activate the virtual environment<br>
   `cd venv/Scripts/` <br>
   `.\activate` <br><br>
   And then go back to the project folder <br>
   `cd ../../`
   
5. Download the required libraries <br>
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run! :D
